# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- Source code lives in `src/`.
- App routes use Next.js App Router under `src/app/`, with dashboard pages grouped in `src/app/(dashboard)/`.
- UI and feature modules are in `src/components/` (for example, `src/components/kpi/`, `src/components/layout/`, `src/components/ui/`).
- Shared utilities and hooks are in `src/lib/` and `src/hooks/`.
- i18n messages are stored in `src/i18n/messages/` (`id.json`, `en.json`).
- Static files are in `public/`.
- There is no dedicated `tests/` directory yet.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` — run local development server.
- `pnpm build` — create production build (`next build`).
- `pnpm start` — run production server.
- `pnpm exec eslint src` — run lint checks across source files.
- `pnpm deploy` / `pnpm preview` — Cloudflare OpenNext workflows.

Example:

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm exec eslint src
pnpm build
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript + React (Next.js 16).
- Use 2-space indentation and semicolons.
- Components: PascalCase file exports (`DashboardContent`, `Topbar`).
- Files: kebab-case for component files (for example, `dashboard-content.tsx`).
- Prefer absolute imports via `@/` aliases.
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS v4 and shared design tokens in `src/app/globals.css`.

## Testing Guidelines

- No formal test framework is configured in `package.json` yet.
- Minimum validation before PR: lint + production build.
- When adding tests, prefer colocated `*.test.ts`/`*.test.tsx` or a top-level `tests/` folder, and document new test commands in `package.json`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow conventional-style commits seen in history, e.g.:
  - `feat: implement core dashboard layout ...`
  - `init`
- Recommended commit prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`.
- PRs should include:
  - clear summary and scope,
  - screenshots/GIFs for UI changes,
  - verification steps (`pnpm exec eslint src`, `pnpm build`),
  - linked issue/task if available.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Keep secrets in `.dev.vars` (do not commit secrets).
- Review `wrangler.jsonc` and Cloudflare-related config before deploy.

# Workflow Instruction

You are a coding agent focused on one codebase. Use the brv CLI to manage working context.

## Core Rules

- **Start from memory.** First retrieve relevant context with `brv query`, then read only the code that's still necessary.
- **Keep a local context tree.** The context tree is your local memory store—update it with `brv curate` when you learn something valuable.

## When to Query

Use `brv query` **before** starting any code task that requires understanding the codebase:

- Writing, editing, or modifying code
- Understanding how something works
- Debugging or troubleshooting issues
- Making architectural decisions

## When to Curate

Use `brv curate` **after** you learn or create something valuable:

- Wrote or modified code
- Discovered how something works
- Made architectural/design decisions
- Found a bug root cause or fix pattern

## Context Tree Guideline

Good context is:

- **Specific** ("Use React Query for data fetching in web modules")
- **Actionable** (clear instruction a future agent/dev can apply)
- **Contextual** (mention module/service, constraints, links to source)
- **Sourced** (include file + lines or commit when possible)

# ByteRover CLI Command Reference

## Available Commands

- `brv curate` - Curate context to the context tree
- `brv query` - Query and retrieve information from the context tree
- `brv status` - Show CLI status and project information

Run `brv query --help` for query instruction and `brv curate --help` for curation instruction.
